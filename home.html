          <h2 class="heading">History of Cricket</h2>
          <!-- Content 5 -->
          <div class="content">
            <p> <strong>Early Origins:</strong> Cricket's origins can be traced back to medieval England, where it was played as a rural pastime in villages. The earliest known reference to cricket dates back to the 16th century. The game evolved over time, with formal rules being established in the 18th century.<br><br>

                <strong>Colonial Expansion:</strong> As the British Empire expanded across the globe during the 18th and 19th centuries, cricket traveled with it. British soldiers, traders, and administrators introduced the game to different parts of the world, including India, Australia, the West Indies, and South Africa.<br><br>
                
                <strong>Introduction to India:</strong> Cricket was introduced to India by the British during the colonial period. The first recorded cricket match in India took place in 1721 in Gujarat. Over time, cricket gained popularity among the Indian elite, and cricket clubs were established in major cities like Calcutta (now Kolkata), Bombay (now Mumbai), and Madras (now Chennai). The game gradually spread to different regions of India, becoming deeply ingrained in the country's sporting culture.<br><br>
                
                <strong>Inter-Colonial Matches:</strong> In the 19th century, inter-colonial matches between Indian and British teams became common, laying the foundation for organized cricket in India. The Bombay Presidency Match of 1845 is considered one of the earliest recorded cricket matches in India.<br><br>
                
                <strong>Rise of Indian Cricket:</strong> After India gained independence from British rule in 1947, cricket continued to thrive and became a symbol of national pride. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) was formed in 1928 to govern and promote cricket in the country. India's victory in the 1983 Cricket World Cup and subsequent successes on the international stage further fueled the nation's passion for the sport.<br><br>
                
                <strong>Global Expansion:</strong> In the latter half of the 20th century and into the 21st century, cricket continued to spread its wings across the globe. International cricket competitions such as the Cricket World Cup, ICC Champions Trophy, and ICC T20 World Cup played a significant role in popularizing the sport in non-traditional cricketing nations. Countries like Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan emerged as cricketing powerhouses, while cricket also gained popularity in countries like Nepal, Ireland, and the Netherlands.<br><br>
                
                <strong>T20 Revolution:</strong> The advent of Twenty20 (T20) cricket in the early 21st century revolutionized the sport and brought it to new audiences. The fast-paced and entertaining format attracted a broader fan base, leading to the establishment of domestic T20 leagues such as the Indian Premier League (IPL), Big Bash League (BBL), and Caribbean Premier League (CPL). These leagues not only provided a platform for established cricketers but also unearthed new talent from around the world.</p>
